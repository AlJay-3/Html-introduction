    <h1> My Skills</h1>

    <h4>
     I dont have much skills, but i think other than my mid playing skill in fighting games, 
     Is my adaptability to certain situations,
     But my adaptability can depend on what am I adapting to,
     if a certain thing truly intrigues me I can and will adapt easily. 
     another one is my skills is in literature, at least i think its one of my skills
     Another one i'd like to mention is a skill im currently developing, which is drawing.
     When i go around on my bike i try to sketch whatever interesting i see.
     As you can see i aint got a lot of skills, Its a miracle that I even reached this point in my life as luck literally carried me here.
